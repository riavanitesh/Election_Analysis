# Election_Analysis
Election Analysis in Python

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections has given is a task to audit the election results and find the popular/winning candidate basis total number of votes and percentage of votes received in the recent congressional election. 
  1.) Total number of votes cast
  2.) A complete list of candidates who received votes
  3.) Total number of votes each candidate received
  4.) Percentage of votes each candidate won
  5.) The winner of the election based on popular vote

## Resources
 - Source of initial data - election_results.csv
 - Output file where the result of the election gets printed - election_analysis.txt
 - Software: Python 3.10 (64bit), Visual Studio Code. 1.38.1
 
 ## Summary
 The analysis of the election as below:
 - Total number of votes cast in the election is "369,711"
 -The candidates were:
      - Charles Casper Stockham
      - Diana DeGette
      - Raymon Anthony Doane
  - The candidates results were:
      - Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
      - Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
      - Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
  - The winner of the elections was:
    -------------------------
    Winner: Diana DeGette
    Winning Vote Count: 272,892
    Winning Percentage: 73.8% 
    -------------------------
   
    - Challenge Overview
       - The biggest challenge was to get the required output
       - The other challenge was to print exactly same result on the .txt file saved in different folder.
       - I am first time python user and it was not at all an easy task, however the module made by UofT made it look so easy and straight forward
  
    - Challenge Summary
        - The coding was not that easy and to get the required output was the biggest challenge especially making variable to variable and using it at the end to print the requried output. In the begining it looked very confusion and difficult to understand, but at the end it seems that python coding is doable. I will have to practise more to gain some confidence
       
       - I felt very surprising about printing the results in a .txt file and that too saved in a different folder. At start it was frustating, but at the end I was convinenced that coding can do anything, provided you know how to make it happen.
